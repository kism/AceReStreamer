# Frontend (Vite + React)

Open a new vscode window in the `frontend/` folder:

```bash
code frontend/
```

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

Run development server, you can use a `.env` file if desired. The variable will affect builds, not just the dev server.

```bash
export VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5100"  # Adjust if your backend is running elsewhere
npm run dev
```
