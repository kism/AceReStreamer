# AceStream Adhoc Playlist

Point your AceStream client that supports M3U playlists to one of the desired urls in the list below.

There are two ways to identify an Ace stream, content id and infohash. The three content id playlists are the same, in different formats.

If you are using AceRestreamer in web mode to serve streams, any will work as a scraper source.

If you are using the Horus addon for Kodi, point it to the Horus specific playlist.

## Streams
{% for playlist_name, playlist_files in playlists.items() %}
### {{playlist_name}}

| Type | URI |
|---|---|
{% for playlist in playlist_files %}| {{ playlist.type }} | `{{playlist.uri}}` |
{% endfor %}{% endfor %}
